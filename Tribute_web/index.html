          <h2>Missile Man of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Pakistani engineer </b>, a key figure in Pakistan’s nuclear
            weapons program who was also involved for decades in a black market
            of nuclear technology and know-how whereby uranium-enrichment
            centrifuges, nuclear warhead designs, missiles, and expertise were
            sold or traded to Iran, North Korea, Libya, and possibly other
            countries. In 1947, during Khan’s childhood, India achieved
            independence from Britain, and Muslim areas in the east and west
            were partitioned to form the state of Pakistan. Khan immigrated to
            West Pakistan in 1952, and in 1960 he graduated from the University
            of Karachi with a degree in metallurgy. Over the next decade he
            pursued graduate studies abroad, first in West Berlin and then in
            Delft, Netherlands, where in 1967 he received a master’s degree in
            metallurgy. In 1972 he earned a doctorate in metallurgical
            engineering from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium.
            Meanwhile, in 1964 he married Hendrina Reterink, a British national
            who had been born to Dutch expatriate parents in South Africa and
            raised in what was then Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) before moving
            to the Netherlands.

          <h3>Biographies:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              At the time of his birth in the mid-1930s, Abdul Qadeer Khan was
              born into the British Raj, or British India, which included
              several nation-states such as modern-day India and Pakistan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Khan was born at a time when the nations of India and Pakistan
              longed to be free of colonial rule.
            </li>
            <li>
              By the early 1940s, World War II was underway, and British India
              was a critical location for allied forces to combat Japanese
              forces in southeast Asia.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite several uprisings within British India, Britain retained
              power throughout the war.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the conclusion of World War II, Britain was concerned by
              tensions continuing to grow in India and was aware of religious
              tensions among Hindus and Muslims.
            </li>
            <li>
              The crown was also concerned about the danger to British citizens
              from a previous mutiny. As a result, Britain sought to transfer
              the power of the British Raj to its people swiftly.
